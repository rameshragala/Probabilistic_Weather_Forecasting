Forecasting weather parameters or variables has uncertainty due to choatic and non-linear nature of the atmosphere. 
What is uncertainity in this context. Understand with an example.
Reducing uncertinity in weather forecasting is an crucial step for getting improved forecast accuracy and reliability.
Ensemble forecasting, which involves running multiple simulations with slight variations in initial conditions and model physics (10, 11), 
provides today the only feasible way to estimate forecast uncertainty through the spread among individual members. 
 Traditional ensemble prediction systems (EPSs) are based on the physics-based numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. 
For example, the state-of-the-art EPS of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF; ECMWF-ENS hereafter) uses techniques 
like the singular vector (SV) approach and the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendency scheme (15, 16) to introduce perturbations 
in initial conditions and physical tendencies, respectively, within its deterministic Integrated Forecast System (IFS).
While increasing the ensemble size can improve uncertainty estimates (15, 17), the substantial computational demands of NWP models constrain ensemble size, limiting the abil-
ity to represent the full probability distribution of possible weather scenarios.
Major global ensemble systems typically have between 14 and 51 members (18–20), underscoring the need for more computationally efficient 
approaches to ensemble forecasting.
